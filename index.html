      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img  title="This picture was taken while I was on a Wolf watching expedition in Yellowstone National Park" src="assets/images/bio-image.png" class="auth-image" alt="Christopher in Yellowstone"/>

      <p> 
        I have a BS in Philosophy, from the University of Utah.
        I enjoy learning new things, I love the impossible, and have many hobbies. I love photography, welding, woodworking, flying drones, making videos, biking, robotics and nature. I am happily married, we have two sons-both of whom attend UC Berkeley and play Rugby for the Bears. Go Bears!
        </p>
        <p>
        My hobbies and interests include (but are not limited to):
        <ul>
          <li title="I pulled my kids from school and sailed to Mexico with my family for 6 months-it was awesome!">Sailing</li>
          <li title="I have a friend who owns a distillery, Sutherland Distilling, in Livermore. I bought 4,000 lbs of wild rice and together we made whiskey! I have made beer since highschool and my sons and I would make mead, which we would then drink from horns while watching the TV series Vikings.">Making Beer, Wine (Mead) and Whiskey</li>
          <li title="I had a friend, Paul Quyle, who taught blacksmithing. After I made my first metal object, I realized it would be around a lot longer than me, I was hooked!">Blacksmithing</li>
          <li title="The first thing I do when I become interested in something is to buy books. I have books on every subject that has ever held my interest, from Artistic Blacksmithing to Zoology">Reading</li>
          <li title="My wife is a graphic designer, I bought her a an old hand-press for her birthday. She was pregnant with our first son. Since she could not be near the solvents associated with printing, I learned how to print and set type and then taught her.">Letter Press Printing</li>
          <li title="I have been fortunate to have, so far, visited 46 countries, swam with whale sharks, been on safari in Africa and toured Northern India. My wife, our dog and I are on a current quest to visit every National Park and to have visited all 50 states.">Adventure</li>
          </ul>
